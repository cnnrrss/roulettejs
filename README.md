### Typescript
Local Declarations Sometimes the package that you want to use doesnâ€™t bundle declarations nor is it available on DefinitelyTyped. In that case, we can have a local declaration file. To do this, create a `declarations.d.ts` file in the root of your source directory. A simple declaration could look like this:
`declare module 'querystring' {
  export function stringify(val: object): string
  export function parse(val: string): object
}`
